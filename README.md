I have made a basic 'Tribute Page' project dedicated to 'Elon Musk'. This is a basic Front End Web page using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap for responsive 
layout which can viewed seamlessly across all platforms such as tab/mobile.


User stories:
1.	I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

2.	I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
